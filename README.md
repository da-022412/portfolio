# Dennis Acosta – Portfolio

This repository contains the code for my personal developer portfolio.  
It’s where I showcase selected projects, skills, and experience as a front-end engineer.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** — framework for fast, modern React apps
- **TypeScript** — type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS** — utility-first styling

## Features

- **Custom design** built without templates or stock themes
- **Responsive layout** optimized for desktop and mobile
- **Clean, accessible UI** with semantic HTML and WCAG best practices
- **Fast performance** through Next.js static generation and optimization
- **Scalable architecture** for adding projects, blog posts, or case studies

## About This Project

This portfolio is more than a website — it’s a demonstration of how I approach front-end engineering:

- Building with modern frameworks (React, Next.js, TypeScript)
- Applying strong UI and accessibility standards
- Structuring code for maintainability and growth
- Delivering performance-focused websites that scale
